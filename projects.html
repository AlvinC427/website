                everything from small experiments to full applications.

                        <em>Ascension</em> is a 2D vertical platformer built with Pygame, developed during my time in Drexel's CI 102 & CI
                        103 courses. It's a Foddian-style game - the kind designed to be frustratingly tough but addicting. Think 
                        "rage platformer" where precision and patience are everything. What made this project valuable wasn't just 
                        the final product, but the process of getting there. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was one of my first times working on a larger, shared codebase, where I had to read, understand, and build on 
                        other people's work. We used GitLab for version control, and I quickly picked up how to manage branches, 
                        resolve merge conflicts, and organize our workflow so we didn't overwrite each other's progress. A lot of 
                        it was new to me - from figuring out how to set up Pygame environments to troubleshooting obscure bugs 
                        we'd occasionally introduce in each other's code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We decided to use Thonny as a lightweight IDE since it was the IDE introduced to us during our CS courses 
                        and it already comes with a python installation and built in package manager so we stuck with it for consistency.
                        I made sure to cleanly document my sections so teammates could easily follow what I was doing. It was a great 
                        exercise in both technical problem-solving and collaborative development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from building the gameplay mechanics and physics, we also took time to polish small details like custom 
                        sprites and sound effects, and even created a demo video that I hope you check out! The project taught me a 
                        lot about structuring game loops, learning a new Python library, and the chaotic fun of balancing difficulty 
                        curves in platformers.
                    </p>

                        This site you're on right now is something I built from scratch as a personal project. It's a simple, clean 
                        portfolio made with plain HTML and CSS, designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to navigate without 
                        relying on site builders or frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While putting this together, I taught myself how to use Visual Studio Code as my main editor, along with 
                        managing project files and previewing pages locally before pushing updates. It gave me a good feel for 
                        working directly with front-end code and structuring a multi-page site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also learned how to deploy and host it on Drexel's Tux Apache web server, which gave me a glimpse into 
                        basic web hosting and maintaining reliable uptime. It's a small project, but one that helped sharpen my 
                        skills in debugging, styling layouts, and experimenting with web design without training wheels.

                        This game is a very simple, arcade-style game I built on my own to practice object-oriented programming 
                        in Python. It started as a late-night idea, and I ended up coding most of it in a single session. 
                        The project focuses on fundamental OOP concepts like class design, inheritance, and managing object 
                        interactions within a Pygame loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond being a fun standalone project, it ended up being a valuable stepping stone towards the end 
                        of the term while working on <em>Ascension</em>. The experience I gained building out game loops, handling 
                        sprite behaviors, and structuring clean, reusable code directly carried over into that much larger team project.

                        This was the first program I ever built. With 2 friends, we developed this as part of our AP 
                        Computer Science Principles exam in high school. The project simulated an online farmer's market with a 
                        basic checkout system, interactive price adjustments, and dynamic item lists. It was built during 
                        9 hours of in-class time for the AP exam requirements, which included coding, recording a demo video, 
                        and writing up a technical explanation (none of which I can find).

                    <p>
                        While simple in functionality and plain in design, this project introduced me to programming fundamentals like 
                        control structures, variables, user interaction, and debugging. It sparked my interest 
                        in software development and gave me a sense of what it's like to build something from scratch.

                        This project was part of my coursework for Drexel's Intro to CS, where we used a custom academic 
                        programming language called <em>Tranquility</em> to design operational state transitions 
                        for a virtual pet simulation. While the visual interface was plain - buttons, images, and a 
                        white canvas - the focus of the project was on applying logical thinking and structured 
                        state management using a finite state machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many students in the course dismissed the language and project as overly niche, but for me, 
                        it was a valuable exercise in learning how to work with unfamiliar tools and staying focused 
                        on core programming concepts. The project helped enhance my programming mindset 
                        and appreciation for language-agnostic problem-solving.
