            <p>
                Here's a collection of fun academic and personal projects I've worked on. This includes 
                everything from small experiments to full applications along with my thoughts on them.

                        In case you were wondering, Foddian games are a genre of games designed to be frustratingly tough yet addicting with precision and patience being everything. 
                        What made this project valuable wasn't just the final product, but everything I learned in the process of getting there. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was one of my first times working on a larger, shared codebase where I had to read, understand, and build on 
                        other people's work. We used GitLab for version control, and I quickly picked up how to manage branches, 
                        resolve merge conflicts, and keep our workflow organized so we didn't accidentally overwrite each other's progress. A lot of 
                        it was new to me; from figuring out how to set up Pygame environments to troubleshooting obscure bugs 
                        we'd occasionally introduce in each other's code, I learned to communicate changes clearly and build on unfamiliar 
			code with confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the project, I made sure to cleanly document my sections so teammates could easily follow what I was 
			doing. It became an easy routine over time and a great exercise in both technical problem-solving and collaborative development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from building the gameplay mechanics and physics, we also took time to polish small details like custom 
                        sprites and sound effects. We even created a demo video that I hope you check out! The project taught me a 
                        lot about structuring game loops, learning a new Python library, and the chaotic fun of balancing difficulty 
                        curves in platformers.
                    </p>

                        This site you're on right now is something I built as a personal project and experiment. It's a simple, clean 
                        portfolio made with plain HTML and CSS designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While putting this together, I taught myself how to use Visual Studio Code as my main editor along with 
                        managing project files and previewing pages locally before pushing updates. It gave me a better feel for 
                        working with front-end code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also learned how to deploy and host it on Drexel's Apache web server, which gave me a glimpse into 
                        basic web hosting and maintaining reliable uptime. It's a small project, but one that helped me regain my 
                        skills in web development.

                        This game is an arcade-style game I built on my own to practice object-oriented programming 
                        in Python. It started as a late-night idea, and I ended up coding most of it before I went to bed. 
                        The project focuses on fundamental OOP concepts like class design, inheritance, and managing object 
                        interactions within a Pygame loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond being a fun standalone project, it ended up being a valuable stepping stone towards the end 
                        of the term while working on <em>Ascension</em>. The experience I gained building out game loops, handling 
                        sprite behaviors, and structuring clean, reusable code directly carried over into that much larger team project.

                        This was the final project for Drexel's Intro to CS course where we had to learn and use a custom
                        programming language called <em>Tranquility</em> to design operational state transitions
                        for a virtual pet simulation. While the visual interface wasn't straightforward with some buttons and images,
                        the focus of the project was on project planning and applying logical thinking to structured
                        state management using a finite state machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although many students in the course dismissed the language and project as overly niche, I thought
                        it was a valuable exercise in learning how to work with unfamiliar tools and staying focused
                        on core programming concepts. The project helped enhance my programming mindset
                        and appreciation for language-agnostic problem-solving.

                        This was the first program I ever built. With 2 friends, we developed this as part of our AP 
                        Computer Science Principles exam in high school. The project simulated an online farmer's market with a 
                        basic checkout system, interactive price adjustments, and dynamic item lists. It was built during 
                        9 hours of in-class time for the AP exam. This included coding, recording a demo video, 
                        and writing up a technical explanation (unfortunately none I can find).

                    <p>
                        This project introduced me to programming fundamentals like control structures, variables, user 
                        interaction, and debugging. It's what sparked my interest in software and web development, giving me a 
                        sense of what it's like to build something from scratch.
